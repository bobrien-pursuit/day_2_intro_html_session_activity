            <h2>Understanding Recycling Processes</h2>
            <p>Recycling transforms waste materials into new products, reducing the need for virgin resources and minimizing environmental impact. It involves collecting, sorting, and processing materials such as paper, glass, plastic, and metals. By recycling, we can conserve natural resources, save energy, and reduce pollution.</p>

            <h2>Effective Waste Management Practices</h2>
            <p>Effective waste management goes beyond recycling. It includes reducing the amount of waste generated, reusing items whenever possible, and disposing of waste responsibly. Composting organic waste, avoiding single-use plastics, and supporting products made from recycled materials are key steps toward sustainable waste management.</p>
